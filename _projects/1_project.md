To start learning Swift, for me it's a new programming language, I decided to create a Todo List App using Swift, and Firebase. Throughout this journey, I've picked up a lot of new skills and knowledge in programming with Swift and integrating Firebase for backend services.

At the beginning I have one choice to make that could change my whole journey. Do I want to start learning the new and modern SwiftUI Framework or do I want to learn the old UIKit Framework. I watched a bunch of videos to decide and here are some pros and cons for SwiftUI:

### **SwiftUI**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>• Newer</td>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Most old Apps still use UIKit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>• Preferred by Apple</td>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Smaller community</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>• Gets updates</td>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Some advanced features may be missing</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>


Although UIKit is preferred by most companies, because most older apps still use it, I decided to learn SwiftUI

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

To start learning a new programming language, I decided to create a Todo List App using SwiftUI, Swift, and Firebase. Throughout this journey, I've picked up a lot of new skills and knowledge in programming with Swift and integrating Firebase for backend services.

Building the Todo List App made me dive deep into the features of SwiftUI, which is Apple's modern framework for building user interfaces across all their platforms. SwiftUI's declarative syntax let me create intuitive and responsive UIs with less code, which was pretty cool compared to traditional UI development. It made the process way more fun and productive.

Integrating Firebase as the backend solution was super valuable for this project. Firebase has a bunch of useful tools and services like Firestore for database management, Firebase Authentication for user authentication, and Firebase Storage for storing user-generated content. Learning how to use these services effectively has given me the skills to build scalable and secure applications.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was making sure the app stayed in sync with the Firebase database in real-time. I had to implement efficient data fetching and updating mechanisms to keep the app's UI in sync with the database state. This involved learning some advanced features of Firebase and understanding asynchronous programming in Swift.

I also focused on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. SwiftUI's powerful and flexible layout system made it possible to design a clean and modern UI that enhances the user experience. I learned how to use SwiftUI's components, modifiers, and animations to create an interactive and dynamic app.

Throughout this journey, I also realized how important it is to write clean and maintainable code. Adopting best practices in code organization, using design patterns like MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), and writing unit tests were essential in making sure the app is reliable and scalable.

Overall, this project has significantly boosted my programming skills and provided me with a solid foundation in using Swift, SwiftUI, and Firebase. The knowledge and experience I've gained from this project will definitely be useful for my future endeavors in iOS development.
